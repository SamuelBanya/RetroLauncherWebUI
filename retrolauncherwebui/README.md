## Retro Launcher

This project is a testament to trying to create a Next.js based web application that would match the styling of Launchbox, which is currently ONLY available on Windows.

With this idea, we could debate getting a similar look and feel to Launchbox but on platforms such as MacOS, and Linux.

This would give users an exciting approach to managing their games, and to not feel left out with all of the retro fun and great features that Launchbox has to offer.
